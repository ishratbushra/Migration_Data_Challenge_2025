## 📌 Challenge Overview
 This hands-on competition empowers undergraduate and graduate students to explore real-world migration issues using underutilized Statistics Canada datasets. Participants analyze disparities in access to essential services, like healthcare, education, and employment, across immigrants, temporary residents, and Canadian-born individuals. It is presented by **Toronto Metropolitan University** in collaboration with the **Innovation Zones**.
## 📊 Dataset Background
 Curated datasets were prepared under the leadership of **Dr. Feng Hou**, Principal Researcher at **Statistics Canada**, provides a solid foundation for exploring spatial inequality and data-driven storytelling.

## 🧠 Research Questions
We focused on the following key questions:
**1.** What is the density of recent immigrants (2016–2021) across Aggregate Dissemination Areas (ADAs)?
**2.** How do immigrant classes (economic, family, refugee, other) access workplace opportunities across regions?
**3.** How do different immigrant generations (first, second, third+) access primary/secondary education?
**4.** Do women refugees face additional barriers to accessing education, employment, and healthcare services?
## 📂 Given Dataset
Provided by Statistics Canada:
- **ADA_profile_simplified.xlsx:** 2021 Census Profile at the ADA level (immigration-related characteristics) *(*saved as csv for ease of use*)*
- **ADA_acs_file.xlsx:** Spatial Access Measures (aggregated at ADA level from Dissemination Block level) *(*saved as csv for ease of use*)*
## Additional Dataset & Resources
- **shapefiles:** Geographic boundary files in .shp format used for spatial visualizations.*https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2021/geo/sip-pis/boundary-limites/index2021-eng.cfm?year=21*
## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Python 3.11
- **Platform:** Google Colab for coding
-**Visualization & Analysis Tools:** Microsoft Excel for pivot tables, data exploration, intermediate calculation
-  **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, geopandas, shapely, folium, openpyxl
## Deliverables
- **Colab Notebooks & py files:** Modular scripts for data processing and visualization.
- **Charts & Tables:** Stacked bar charts, Group bar charts, Choropleth maps, Table.
- **Report:** Final PDF with visual findings and analysis.
- **Shapefiles:** For geographic analysis.
- **Presentation Slides:** Summary of findings .
