# Bridging Divides Migration Data Challenge 2025 
----------------
## ðŸ“Œ Challenge Overview
The challenge explores underutilized Statistics Canada datasets to uncover geographic disparities in access to essential services and amenities, particularly for immigrants, temporary residents, and Canadian-born populations.
## ðŸ§  Research Questions
We focused on the following key questions:
**1.** What is the density of recent immigrants (2016â€“2021) across Aggregate Dissemination Areas (ADAs)?
**2.** How do immigrant classes (economic, family, refugee, other) access workplace opportunities across regions?
**3.** How do different immigrant generations (first, second, third+) access primary/secondary education?
**4.** Do women refugees face additional barriers to accessing education, employment, and healthcare services?
## ðŸ“‚ Given Dataset
Provided by Statistics Canada:
- **ada_profile_simplified.xlsx:** 2021 Census Profile at the ADA level (immigration-related characteristics).(saved as csv for ease of use)
- **ADA_acs_file.xlsx:** Spatial Access Measures (aggregated at ADA level from Dissemination Block level) ).(saved as csv for ease of use)
## Additional Dataset & Resources
- **shapefiles:** Geographic boundary files in .shp format used for spatial visualizations.
## Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Python 3.11
- **Platform:** Google Colab for coding
-**Visualization & Analysis Tools:** Microsoft Excel for pivot tables, data exploration, intermediate calculation
-  **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, geopandas, shapely, folium, openpyxl
## Deliverables
- **Colab Notebooks & py files:** Modular scripts for data processing and visualization.
- **Charts & Tables:** Stacked bar charts, Group bar charts, Choropleth maps, Table.
- **Report:** Final PDF with visual findings and analysis.
- **Shapefiles:** For geographic analysis.
- **Presentation Slides:** Summary of findings .
